README  for HELLO UNIVERS

This is my first adventure in GIT-HUB. 
All this for my university class in Agile Programming


I will compleat this readme as I go along.

The steps I took so far are.

Intalling Git on diffrent computers at home.  To test it. 
Wich I only did the istalle and watch 2hours presentation on the git site. <


3- created a git-hub public acount  and installed git again from thier web site.

This one gave me a git short-cut .  The other one I had to find the start up in the directories

 4- Follwed the instrucntions on the first page after the logon. and now created

my first project with this file..

ok lets save this and commit it.
